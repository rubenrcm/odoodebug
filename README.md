# odoodebug

This is a simple extension to enable debug mode on odoo.

# Why
In the lastest versions of odoo, developer mode has been moved at the configuration zone. That means that you have to leave your actual page and loose tons of time to return at the same place.
This extensions emulate the old configuration, so, you click the bug button and reload the same page with the developer mode enable.
